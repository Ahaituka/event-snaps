# EventSnaps

Welcome to EventSnaps, an innovative facial recognition-based platform specifically designed for weddings, events, and special occasions. This application makes it easier than ever to organize, manage, and share photos taken at your event. EventSnaps compares and groups photos based on the faces detected in them, allowing you and your guests to efficiently browse through the captured moments and memories of your special day.

## Introduction

EventSnaps addresses the challenges associated with managing and organizing photographs from weddings, events, and special occasions by offering a centralized solution for:

- Disorganized and scattered photos: Event attendees often take numerous photos, which can become scattered across various devices and platforms. EventSnaps centralizes these images, making them accessible in one organized location.

- Difficulty in finding specific moments or individuals: Manually browsing through hundreds or even thousands of photos to locate specific moments or individuals can be time-consuming and frustrating. EventSnaps leverages advanced facial recognition technology to automatically group images by detected faces, making it easy for users to find pictures of particular guests or moments.

- Cumbersome sharing and downloading process: Sharing photos with friends, family, or event attendees can be a complex and time-consuming task, especially when dealing with multiple platforms or file formats. EventSnaps offers straightforward options for sharing and downloading images, either individually or in bulk, making the process seamless and efficient.

- Lack of privacy and control over shared images: Many photo-sharing platforms do not offer robust privacy controls or customization options. EventSnaps provides users with secure storage and sharing of their event images, allowing them to maintain control over their content and privacy.
